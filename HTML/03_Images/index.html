<!--Accessibility: 
        The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for an image, 
        which is displayed in place of the image if it cannot be loaded or if the user 
        is using assistive technologies such as screen readers. This ensures that users 
        with visual impairments or those who have disabled images can still understand the 
        purpose or content of the image. It also helps search engines understand the content 
        of the image, which can improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).     -->

<!--Usability: 
        When an image fails to load due to slow internet connections or other issues, 
        the alt attribute provides a descriptive text fallback, giving users context about 
        the missing image. Similarly, the title attribute provides additional information about 
        the image when users hover their cursor over it. This enhances the overall usability and 
        user experience of the webpage.                                                         -->
